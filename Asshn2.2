HDFS
Java-based file system which gives data storage solutions which are reliable and scalable.
It istributes storage and computing across many machines, and hence the storage resouces 
can grow linearly and still remain economical.

Hadoop cluster
it is a speacial kind of cluster which is designed specially for storage and analysis of 
huge amounts of unstructured data in a distributed computing environment.

HDFS Blocks
The HDFS breaks files down to a set of blocks and stores in slave nodes of the Hadoop cluster.
The blocks are all evenly sized.The block size is high.
- Every data block haas its own metadata and is tracked by a central server.
- High throughput , the processing of these data blocks parallely and quickly.
